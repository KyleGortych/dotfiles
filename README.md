## Literate Refactoring 
Reminder to view raw on dotfiles.org to see actual syntax.
## dir descript
This repo's root is treated as home, as such any paths that are up a directory will follow normal path conventions. Any config files that don't have a symbolic link to .config will also follow normal path conventions. 
## Reminder
Remember if you plan on commiting config files to a git repo, to omit api keys or other env variables that contain possible security risks beforehand to prevent privilege escalation.
