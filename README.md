# dotfiles
sys config files for various applications 
## dir descript
I am still learning about env variables and build sys protocal, as such this repo is liable to change. I try to adhere to the XDG Base Directory Specification ie. .config. Other config files and respective directories are mostly within home or have been specified.
## Reminder
Remember if you plan on commiting config files to a git repo, to omit api keys or other env variables that contain possible security risks beforehand to prevent privilege escalation.
